Second assignment needed in order to perfect bootstrap
My Second upload was the basic layout the I wanted
I found out that we could have used a template however I'd prefer building using bootstrap items alone.
My navbar was essentially broken until I was able to get into a zoom meeting with Ron and Zyed who helped me sort it out.
Notes for today involve adding links to my about me/home page which were hard to implement correctly. Took about three hours to figure out that I missed some tags and they were placed incorrectly. W3 schools helped.
Adding photos that could also link to absolute pages was of moderate difficulty and took some doing.
The navbar wasn't consistent becuase of the grid system, it misaligned and the content was also ajar.
It could only be fixed by takinng away the container class.This aligned it to the left.
I tried to use the float sytem on my hoe page, couldn't get it working.
If I had more time I would've started again furthering my knowledge of spacing within the container sytem provided in bootstrap. 
Next time I will use a template if allowed in order to increase complexity and streamline my workflow.
